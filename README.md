# Ogram
We made a funny R package!
No idea if this is going to work.
:)
I think you have to download all of the files I uploaded and then see if it will run? I am not sure. 


Plan of action: download all of the files into one folder (you can download as a zip file). Then just try running library("ogram") in R and see if it works. Please email me if it works!!
